Unbiased gene set enrichment analysis for genome-wide DNA methylation data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This site contains the results of the analysis presented in 
*“Unbiased gene set enrichment analysis for genome-wide DNA methylation data”*. 
Follow the links below to see the different parts of the analysis. For details
on how to reproduce the complete analyis, please see the 
[Getting started](gettingStarted.html) page.


Analysis
--------
1. [Explore EPIC array bias](exploreArrayBiasEPIC.html)
    * Explore the various array biases on the EPIC array that affect gene set testing.
      
2. [Explore 450k array bias](exploreArrayBias450.html)
    * Explore the various array biases on the 450k array that affect gene set testing.

3. [Generate a blood cell RNAseq "truth" set](expressionGenesets.html)
    * Analyse an RNAseq sorted blood cell dataset and identify the top ranked 
      gene sets for each cell type comparison.
      
4. [Compare FDR of different methods](fdrAnalysis.html)
    * Analyse the normal samples from a 450k array KIRC TCGA dataset using 
      various genset testing methods to estimate their false discovery rate control.
      
5. [Compare performance of different methods](exploreData.html)
    * Analyse an EPIC array sorted blood cell dataset using various gene set 
      testing methods. Compare how well the different methods perform using several 
      metrics.

6. [Compare run-time of different methods](runTimeComparison.html)
    * Analyse an EPIC array sorted blood cell dataset using various gene set 
      testing methods. Compare the run-time of the different methods.

7. [Effect of gene set size parameters on methylGSA](methylGSAParamSweep.html)
    * Analyse an EPIC array sorted blood cell dataset using various gene set 
      testing methods. Compare the run-time of the different methods.
      
8. [Evaluate GOregion](regionAnalysis.html)
    * Evalulate GOregion, our extension of gometh for geneset testing of 
      differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified by DMR finding software.

9. [Restricting Sig. CpGs in GOmeth by genomic region](gomethByFeature.html)
    * Evalulate the impact of on gene set testing using GOmeth of restricting 
      significant CpGs based on genomic feature using the EPIC sorted blood cell 
      dataset.
