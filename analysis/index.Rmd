# Gene set testing for methylation arrays

This site contains the development and evaluation of various methylation array 
gene set testing methods available in the Bioconductor [missMethyl package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/missMethyl.html). 
Follow the links below to explore the 
different parts of the project. 


Analysis
--------
* Explore EPIC array bias
    * [EPIC array bias](exploreArrayBiasEPIC.html) - Explore the various 
      array biases that affect gene set testing.
      
* Explore 450k array bias
    * [450k array bias](exploreArrayBias450.html) - Explore the various 
      array biases that affect gene set testing.

* Blood cell RNAseq "truth" set
    * [RNAseq analysis](expressionGenesets.html) - Analyse an RNAseq sorted blood cell 
      dataset and identify the top ranked gene sets for each cell type comparison.
      
* Compare methods
    * [Compare methods](exploreData.html) - Analyse an EPIC array sorted blood cell 
      dataset using various gene set testing methods. Compare the results of the different 
      methods.

* Compare run-time of methods
    * [Compare run-time](runTimeComparison.html) - Analyse an EPIC array sorted blood cell 
      dataset using various gene set testing methods. Compare the run-time of the different 
      methods.
      
* Compare false discovery rate of different methods
    * [Compare false discovery rate](fdrAnalysis.html) - Analyse the normal samples from
      a 450k array KIRC TCGA dataset using various genset testing methods to 
      estimate their false discovery rate control.
      
* Gene set testing of regions
    * [Region analysis](regionAnalysis.html) - Evalulate the use of gometh for geneset 
      testing of differentially methylated regions from region finding software.
